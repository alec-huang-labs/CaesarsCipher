# Caesar's Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.<br>
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.<br><br>
rot13("SERR CVMMN!") should decode to FREE PIZZA! <br>
rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC") should decode to FREE CODE CAMP
